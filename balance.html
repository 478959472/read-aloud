      Read Aloud's Amazon voices use Amazon's text-to-speech service, which is billed at $4 per million characters.
      At this price, <b>it is not yet cost-effective to use Amazon voices to read books, novels, or very large articles</b>.
      For these purposes, please use one of Google's native voices instead.
    </p>
    <p>
      If you choose to use Amazon voices, you get 100,000 free characters per month.  After that, you can purchase
      additional characters <a href="purchase.html">by going here</a>.
    </p>
    <p>
      After purchasing, you will receive a code that can be redeemed by entering it below.  Purchased characters will be
      added on top of your free characters.  The free characters will be used up first, before the purchased characters applies.
      Also, we save the generated speech audio for 30 days, so rereading the same text or article again will not incur additional cost.
